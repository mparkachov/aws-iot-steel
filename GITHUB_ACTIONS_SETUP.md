# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
- **Main CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  - Code quality checks (rustfmt, clippy, security audit)
  - macOS testing (development platform)
  - ESP32-C3 cross-compilation
  - Firmware signing and packaging
  - Secure artifact upload to AWS S3 using OIDC

- **Steel Programs Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/steel-programs.yml`)
  - Steel program validation and syntax checking
  - Steel program packaging with metadata
  - Secure upload of Steel programs to AWS

- **Security Monitoring** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
  - Daily security audits with `cargo audit`
  - Dependency license checking
  - Outdated dependency monitoring
  - Supply chain security with `cargo deny`

### 2. Supporting Configuration
- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) - Automated dependency updates
- **Code Owners** (`.github/CODEOWNERS`) - Code review assignments
- **Setup Script** (`scripts/setup-github-actions.sh`) - Automated AWS/GitHub setup

### 3. Code Quality Fixes
- Fixed all clippy warnings and errors
- Fixed formatting issues with `cargo fmt`
- Resolved security audit warnings
- All tests now pass (156 tests across the workspace)

## üîß Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Now
- Code quality checks (rustfmt, clippy, security audit)
- Rust unit and integration tests
- Basic compilation for both macOS and ESP32 targets

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Setup Before Full Pipeline Works
- AWS OIDC provider and IAM roles
- GitHub repository secrets
- S3 buckets for artifact storage

### ‚ùå Will Fail Until Setup Complete
- ESP32 cross-compilation (needs ESP-IDF setup in CI)
- AWS artifact upload (needs secrets)
- Steel program validation (needs missing binaries)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### To Enable Full Pipeline:
1. **Run the setup script**: `./scripts/setup-github-actions.sh`
2. **Create missing Rust binaries**:
   - `steel_program_validator`
   - `steel_test` 
   - `steel_example`
3. **Test the pipeline** by pushing to a feature branch

### To Complete Task 11.2:
- Implement AWS CodePipeline configuration
- Create CloudFormation templates for CI/CD infrastructure
- Set up secure artifact transfer from GitHub to AWS

## üìä Test Results
```
aws-iot-core: 68 tests passed
aws-iot-platform-macos: 27 tests passed  
aws-iot-tests: 61 tests passed
Total: 156 tests passed, 0 failed
```

## üîí Security Status
- 1 warning: `atomic-polyfill` unmaintained (transitive ESP32 dependency)
- All other security checks passed
- No known vulnerabilities in direct dependencies

## üéØ Hybrid CI/CD Architecture Implemented

**GitHub Actions** handles:
- Rust cross-compilation for ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-1
- Comprehensive test suites (Rust + Steel)
- Code quality checks and security auditing
- Firmware signing and artifact creation
- Secure artifact transfer to AWS S3

**AWS CodePipeline** (to be implemented in task 11.2) will handle:
- CloudFormation stack deployment and updates
- AWS IoT configuration and device provisioning
- Steel program packaging and distribution
- OTA deployment orchestration
- Infrastructure validation and rollback

This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both platforms for optimal CI/CD performance.
