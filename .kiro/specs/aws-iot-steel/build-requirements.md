# Build and CI/CD Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the build, compilation, testing, and CI/CD requirements for the ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-1 embedded module project.

2. WHEN GitHub Actions runs tests THEN it SHALL execute all Rust integration tests with mock AWS services
3. WHEN GitHub Actions runs tests THEN it SHALL execute all Steel test programs using the Steel test runner
4. WHEN testing on Linux THEN GitHub Actions SHALL use Ubuntu runners and test Linux-specific functionality
5. WHEN testing cross-compilation THEN GitHub Actions SHALL verify ESP32 target compilation without execution
6. WHEN tests fail THEN GitHub Actions SHALL provide detailed error messages and fail the build
7. WHEN all tests pass THEN GitHub Actions SHALL proceed to artifact creation and deployment stages
8. WHEN testing Steel programs THEN the system SHALL validate Steel program execution and API integration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure artifact management and signing, so that firmware and Steel programs are cryptographically signed and securely distributed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN firmware is built THEN GitHub Actions SHALL sign the firmware with cryptographic signatures
2. WHEN Steel programs are packaged THEN the system SHALL create signed Steel program packages
3. WHEN artifacts are created THEN the system SHALL generate checksums and metadata for all artifacts

5. WHEN artifacts are stored THEN S3 SHALL encrypt artifacts at rest and enforce secure access policies
6. WHEN artifacts are downloaded THEN the system SHALL verify signatures and checksums before installation
7. WHEN signing keys are managed THEN the system SHALL use secure key management and never expose private keys
8. WHEN artifact versions are managed THEN the system SHALL implement semantic versioning and track artifact history

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated AWS infrastructure deployment, so that AWS resources are consistently deployed and managed through infrastructure as code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN artifacts are uploaded to S3 THEN AWS CodePipeline SHALL automatically trigger infrastructure deployment
2. WHEN CodePipeline executes THEN AWS CodeBuild SHALL deploy CloudFormation templates for IoT infrastructure
3. WHEN CloudFormation deploys THEN the system SHALL create or update AWS IoT Core things, certificates, and policies
