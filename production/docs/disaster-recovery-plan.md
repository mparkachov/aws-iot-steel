## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups

#### 1. S3 Cross-Region Replication
```yaml
# Enabled for all critical buckets
Primary Region: us-west-2
Backup Region: us-east-1
Replication: Real-time
Retention: 90 days
```

#### 2. CloudFormation Template Backup
```bash
# Daily backup of all templates
aws s3 sync ./aws-infrastructure/cloudformation/ \
  s3://aws-iot-steel-dr-backup/cloudformation/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
```

#### 3. Device Certificate Backup
```bash
# Weekly backup of device certificates
aws iot list-things --output json > device-inventory-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json
aws s3 cp device-inventory-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json \
  s3://aws-iot-steel-dr-backup/certificates/
```

#### 4. Configuration Backup
```bash
# Daily backup of production configurations
aws s3 sync ./production/config/ \
  s3://aws-iot-steel-dr-backup/config/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
```

### Manual Backups

#### 1. Weekly System State Snapshot
- Export all IoT policies and rules
- Document current device fleet status
- Backup monitoring dashboards and alarms
- Archive deployment artifacts

#### 2. Monthly DR Testing
- Validate backup integrity
- Test recovery procedures
- Update documentation
- Train team members

## Recovery Procedures

### Scenario 1: Complete AWS Region Failure

#### Detection
- CloudWatch alarms indicate complete service unavailability
- Multiple services report failures across the region
- AWS Service Health Dashboard confirms regional issues

#### Response Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Activate incident response team
   # Switch to backup region (us-east-1)
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   
   # Verify backup region accessibility
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Recovery (15-60 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Deploy infrastructure in backup region
   cd aws-infrastructure/scripts
   ./deploy-core-infrastructure.sh production us-east-1
   ./deploy-s3-lambda.sh production us-east-1
   ./deploy-codepipeline.sh production us-east-1
   ```

3. **Data Recovery (60-120 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Restore S3 data from cross-region replication
   aws s3 sync s3://aws-iot-steel-programs-backup/ \
     s3://aws-iot-steel-programs-us-east-1/
   
   # Restore device certificates
   ./restore-device-certificates.sh us-east-1
   ```

4. **Device Reconnection (120-240 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Update device configurations with new endpoints
   # Devices will automatically reconnect with exponential backoff
   # Monitor connection status via CloudWatch
   ```

### Scenario 2: IoT Core Service Outage

#### Detection
- IoT Core connection failures spike
- Device shadow operations fail
- MQTT message delivery stops

#### Response Steps

1. **Immediate Assessment (0-5 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Check AWS Service Health Dashboard
   # Verify if outage is regional or service-wide
   aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS
   ```

2. **Implement Workarounds (5-30 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Enable device-side message queuing
   # Activate offline mode for critical operations
   # Notify stakeholders of service degradation
   ```

3. **Monitor and Escalate (30-120 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Open AWS Support case (if not already aware)
   # Implement alternative communication channels if available
   # Prepare for potential region failover
   ```

### Scenario 3: S3 Bucket Corruption/Deletion

#### Detection
- S3 access errors in application logs
- Missing firmware or Steel programs
- Backup validation failures

#### Response Steps

1. **Immediate Containment (0-10 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Stop all automated deployments
   # Prevent further data loss
   aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
     --bucket aws-iot-steel-programs \
     --versioning-configuration Status=Suspended
   ```

2. **Assess Damage (10-20 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # List affected objects
   aws s3 ls s3://aws-iot-steel-programs/ --recursive
   
   # Check version history
   aws s3api list-object-versions \
     --bucket aws-iot-steel-programs
   ```

3. **Restore from Backup (20-60 minutes)**
   ```bash
   # Restore from cross-region replica
   aws s3 sync s3://aws-iot-steel-programs-backup/ \
     s3://aws-iot-steel-programs/ --delete
   
   # Verify integrity
   ./verify-s3-integrity.sh
   ```

---

## Recovery Validation

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run end-to-end validation after recovery
cargo run --bin end_to_end_validator --package aws-iot-tests -- \
  --test-suite all --verbose

# Validate device connectivity
./validate-device-connectivity.sh

# Check Steel program delivery
./test-steel-program-delivery.sh
```

### Manual Verification Checklist

- [ ] IoT Core endpoints responding
- [ ] Device certificates valid and accessible
- [ ] S3 buckets contain expected data
- [ ] Lambda functions operational
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting active
- [ ] Sample devices can connect and receive programs
